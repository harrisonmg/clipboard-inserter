# Fork information  

- ✅ Updated the clipboard reading method to reduce the performance impact of the addon by ~90%. This also lets you copy a paragraph with its newlines intact.  
- ➕ Added automatic url detection with an option (requires new "tabs" and "access all urls" permissions)  
- ➕ Added prepend/append option  
- 🔄 Added prepend/append option  
- 🔄 Formatted all files and added semicolons (sorry I had to do it.)  

I am very willing to send a push request to update the main repo (kmltml/clipboard-inserter) but with this many changes and added permissions I'm not sure what the addon creator would think about that. Let me know.  

### **Installation (Firefox only)**  
For now you can download the signed .xpi file under [**Releases**](https://github.com/Onurtag/clipboard-inserter/releases/latest) and install it using drag-and-drop.

# Clipboard Inserter

A simple addon whose purpose is to automatically insert contents of clipboard into the page.

If you're looking to install this addon, it's available here:

On Chrome, if you want to use this extension with local files (the `file://` protocol), you have to enable the "Allow access to file URLs" setting in the extension details.
