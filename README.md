# Clipboard Inserter Redux  
## Fork information  

- âœ… Updated the clipboard reading method to reduce the performance impact of the addon by ~90%. This also lets you copy a paragraph with its newlines intact.  
- âž• Added automatic url detection with an option (requires new "tabs" and "access all urls" permissions)  
- âž• Added prepend/append option  
- ðŸ”„ Formatted all files and added semicolons (sorry I had to do it.)  

I am very willing to send a push request to update the main repo (kmltml/clipboard-inserter) but with this many changes and added permissions I'm not sure what the addon creator would think about that. Let me know.  

### **Installation (Firefox)**  
You can download the signed .xpi file under [**Releases**](https://github.com/Onurtag/clipboard-inserter/releases/latest) and install it using drag-and-drop.  

### **Installation (Some Chromium browsers)**  
If your Chromium browser fork is able to install unpacked extensions (such as **Vivaldi**); you can download the [**chromium branch zip**](https://github.com/Onurtag/clipboard-inserter/archive/refs/heads/clipboard-inserter-chrome.zip) and install it as an unpacked extension.

# Clipboard Inserter  

A simple addon whose purpose is to automatically insert contents of clipboard into the page.

If you're looking to install this addon, it's available here:

 - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/clipboard-inserter/)
 - [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clipboard-inserter/deahejllghicakhplliloeheabddjajm)

Or, if the links don't work, just search for "clipboard inserter" in the appropriate addon market.

On Chrome, if you want to use this extension with local files (the `file://` protocol), you have to enable the "Allow access to file URLs" setting in the extension details.
